# Home-Automation-System-Tank-Filling-

The goal of the project is automatic water filling system using Arduino Nano. The device also has RTC support to avoid over billing in areas with time-based tariffs and buzzer for
indicating errors. It also incorporates dry motor run protection to protect the pump from over heating incase of no water supply. The RTC is used for time calibration and setting turn on / off time of the system (for example not to turn on the pump at night).

The Project uses the following components.
